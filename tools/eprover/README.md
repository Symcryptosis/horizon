# Horizon Ethereum Prover (EProver)
EProver is a utility that provides verifiable proof about userâ€™s Ethereum tx, e.g., lock tx. A reference implementation is available under [near's eth-proof-extractor](https://github.com/near/rainbow-bridge-lib/blob/master/eth-proof-extractor/index.js), which can be used to develop this component.
